### Mission Statement
Children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are currently being underserved by expensive therapy sessions and medical attention that ends at the home's front door. Smile is a mobile application that teaches kids with ASC how to recognize emotions, and lets them practice those emotions using their own face. We use real-time facial recognition to gamify the learning experience, bringing it out of the therapist's office, and into the home, the supermarket, or any where else that real emotional interactions take place.

### What's our goal?
Children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have major difficulties recognizing, responding to, and interpreting mental/emotional states in facial expressions. These difficulties can result from social communication problems that result in a lack of empathy. Therefore, one of the many basic principles behind addressing the above problem is whether or not empathy can be taught.
Empathy can be broadly categorized into two components: cognitive (recognizing another person’s mental state) and affective (reacting to another person’s mental state). Indeed, various research studies have shown that cognitive empathy can be taught.  
In building an artificially intelligent emotion recognition platform that will act as a tutorial for kids with autism spectrum disorder we intend to teach cognitive empathy by running the user through multiple basic expressions (and their meaning) and testing them by making them recreate the expressions which will be detected/judged by the AI.

### Who is this for?
<<<<<<< HEAD
The tutorial would initially be for parents of kids with ASC and medical/educational institutions and would be aimed at improving the cognitive empathy of kids with ASC. Based on feedback from parents of kids with ASC, and even medical institutions, the system could be pivoted to a bigger software project that tests for ASC by scoring cognitive ability, and decide if the tutorial will be helpful for the test-taker. Our app could also be used more broadly to teach small children how to recognize emotions.
